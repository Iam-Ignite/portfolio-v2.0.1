                    <p className={mode}>Hey there ðŸ˜ƒ<br/>
                        My name is Faith Godwin and i am a web developer and freelancer with over 2 years of experience, over the years i has used quite a vairity of technologies.</p>
                        <p className={mode}>From the very start, i have always had a thing for technology and how it works, even as a kid i would like to use my broken toys and some electronic gadgets and start experimenting with them to see if i could invent some new.
                       Up until i was 17 i wasn't sure of what career path to take until my big brother introduce a whole new world you guess it, programming.</p>
                        <p className={mode}>I aways wonder how mobile games where made and how to create a website, So i decided to learn programming and to my greatest surprise i understood it, though it wasn't an easy ride i felt like i was making the word better one code at a time.  
                           Time passed which gave me the opportunity start an internship.</p>
